## 🎭 Character Bio

**Hopscotch the Show Frog**  
A dry-witted, horned frog who leads a travelling circus troupe. Formerly a well-dweller, he now journeys to experience the wider world. Despite his seemingly unbothered exterior, he's prone to homesickness and always carries a special tankard of water from his home to soothe his nerves during performances.

At the end of each show, Hopscotch performs a **signature toast** — a heartfelt tribute to his origins and a gesture of gratitude to his audience.
